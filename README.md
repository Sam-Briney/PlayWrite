# PlayWrite

PlayWrite was originally released as propriety basketball drawing software on [CoachesBrain.com](https://coachesbrain.com). It was originally a project that I was using to learn a bit of programming, way back when jQuery was the talk of the town. It is now free and open source. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux using [NW.js](https://nwjs.io) v0.93.0. For pre-packaged binaries please visit [https://coachesbrain.com/playwrite/download/](https://coachesbrain.com/playwrite/download/).
