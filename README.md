# PlayWrite

PlayWrite was originally released as propriety basketball drawing software on [CoachesBrain.com](https://coachesbrain.com). The code was originally written by a high school kid who was trying to learn javascript on his mom's desktop which ran Windows XP back in the days when [jQuery](https://jquery.com) was the best thing on planet earth, [node.js](https://nodejs.dev) was still a toddler, and Internet Explorer still had 20% market share. The project makes use of an old version of [NW.js](https://nwjs.io), so old it was called node-webkit back then. The code is not the cleanest thing in the world (understatement of the day) but it works and maybe someone will still find it useful. My hope is a coach is able to use this to help his players improve their tactical knowledge of basketball so that they may carry that knowledge to the highest levels of the game.   

# Running It
On Windows just download the repository and run the executable nw.exe. It's really that easy.
