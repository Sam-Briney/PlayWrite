# PlayWrite

PlayWrite was originally released as propriety basketball drawing software on [CoachesBrain.com](https://coachesbrain.com). The code was originally written by a high school kid who was trying to learn javascript back in the days when jQuery was the best thing on planet earth. The project makes use of an old version of NW.js, so old it was called node-webkit back then. The code is not the cleanest thing in the world (understatement of the day) but it works and maybe someone will still find it useful. 

# Running It
On Windows just download the repository and run the executable nw.exe. It's really that easy.
