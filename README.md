# PlayWrite

PlayWrite was originally released as propriety basketball drawing software on [CoachesBrain.com](https://coachesbrain.com). The code was originally written by a high school kid who was trying to learn javascript on his mom's desktop which ran Windows XP back in the days when [jQuery](https://jquery.com) was the best thing on planet earth, [node.js](https://nodejs.dev) was a toddler, and Internet Explorer still had 20% market share. The project makes use of an old version (8.6) of [NW.js](https://nwjs.io), so old it was called node-webkit back then. The code is not the cleanest thing in the world (understatement of the day) but it works and maybe someone will still find it useful. My hope is that a coach is able to use this program to help his players improve their tactical knowledge of basketball so that they may carry a deep understanding of offense and defense to the highest levels of the game.   

# Running It
On Windows just download the repository and run the executable nw.exe. It's really that easy. 

Theoretically you should be able to get it working on Mac or Linux just fine if you know what you're doing since NW.js supports those platforms. You just need to replace the Windows NW.js version with the appropriate one from [NW.js](https://nwjs.io). However I haven't tried so good luck! I doubt it could be terribly difficult (famous last words).
