# PlayWrite

PlayWrite was originally released as propriety basketball drawing software on [CoachesBrain.com](https://coachesbrain.com). The code was originally written by a high school kid who was trying to learn javascript on his mom's desktop which ran Windows XP back in the days when [jQuery](https://jquery.com) was the best thing on planet earth, [node.js](https://nodejs.dev) was a toddler, and Internet Explorer still had 20% market share. The project makes use of an old version (8.6) of [NW.js](https://nwjs.io), so old it was called node-webkit back then. The code is not the cleanest thing in the world (understatement of the day) but it works and maybe someone will still find it useful. My hope is that a coach is able to use this program to help his players improve their tactical knowledge of basketball so that they may carry a deep understanding of offense and defense to the highest levels of the game.   

# Installation
This method will work on Windows.

1. To download this repository, click the green button labeled `code` on the top right of this page, then click `Download ZIP`.
2. After you download the zip folder, you need to extract it. Right click zip file and then click `extract all`.
3. Once you have extracted the folder, simply double click `nw.exe` to run the software.

I have also run it on Linux previously; however, you will have to replace NW.js with the appropriate version by downloading it from [NW.js](https://nwjs.io).
